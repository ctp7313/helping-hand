### Project Description

With this application we intend to provide the homeless population in King County accessible information on health, shelter, and food services with a dynamically engineered application!

1. Health
    * Urgent care
    * Behavioral health
    * Dental health

2. Shelter
    * Immediate shelter
    * Longer term

3. Food
    * Served meals
    * Food banks

4. Daily Care

### User Story

There is no better feeling in this world than to lend a helping hand to someone who is need of one. Whether it be a family member, close friends, or even a homeless person on the street, one of these individuals can always use the help. So we see this application as an opportunity to benefit people experiencing homelessness and working-poor communities, providing them a helping hand that they need to get their basic needs met.

```
AS A person experiencing homelessness
I WANT to have information about services in King County
SO THAT I can get my basic needs of food, shelter, and health met.
```
